### Postdoc opportunities

If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, then please [email me](mailto:m.reuter@ucl.ac.uk). A number of externally funded schemes are available for all levels of experience and I am happy to talk about possible projects that combine your and our research interests and assist you with preparing an application.


### PhD studentships

We are always looking for clever and motivated PhD students. At UCL, studentships are available through two doctoral training programmes, the [London NERC DTP](https://london-nerc-dtp.org) and the [BBSRC LIDo DTP](https://www.lido-dtp.ac.uk). We usually offer projects through both, but it's a good idea to email me before applying. Applications for both programmes open in the autumn, with deadlines in December or January.
